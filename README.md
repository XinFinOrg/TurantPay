# Turant Pay (P2P Remittance standard)

Turant Pay is a P2P Remittance standard built on the XDC Protocol. The standard is being designed to be pluggable by remittance companies and use XDC as a digital asset to relay liquidity from one peer to another across geographically spread locations and fiat currencies.
